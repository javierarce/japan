    <h3>Hello, <%= username %>!</h3>

    <p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks for your wonderful recommendations! I had a great time in Japan as you can see from <a href="http://photos.javier.is/tagged/japan">these photos</a> I took :)</p>

    <p>
      As you may have heard, I'm planning a trip to Japan at the end of May. It'll be my very first time there and my FOMO levels are skyrocketing. What places should I visit? Where should I eat? What are the hidden secrets of this magical and crazy island? Please, help me by adding some of your favorite spots using the search field up there.
