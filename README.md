Japan
==================================

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierarce/my-jp-trip/master/public/img/japan.gif)

As you may have heard, I’m planning a trip to Japan at the end of May. It’ll be my very first time there and my FOMO levels are skyrocketing, so I built a website to let seasoned japanophiles like you to help me.

What places should I visit? Where should I eat? What should I avoid? What are the hidden secrets of this magical and crazy island? Please, <a href="http://japan.javierarce.com">let me know</a> and I'll be forever grateful.

### Installation

Quick start:

1. Create a <a href="http://www.cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> account.

4. Get the code `git clone git@github.com:javierarce/japan.git`.
5. Rename ```lib/config.sample.js``` to ```lib/config.js``` and add your CartoDB and Twitter credentials.
